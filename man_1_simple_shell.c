.SH NAME
.B simple_shell
- simple UNIX command interpreter.

.SH SYNOPSIS
simple_shell

.SH ARGUMENTS
An interactive shell is one started without non-option arguments.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a UNIX command line interpreter that display a prompt and wait for the user
 to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line. The prompt is
 displayed again each time a command has been executed. Use the PATH, and
 handle commands with arguments.

The current version of simple_shell is in the process of being changed to
conform with the Holberton School specifications for the shell.  This version
has many features which make it appear similar in some respects to the SH
shell, but it is not a SH shell clone (see sh(1)).  Only features designated
by Holberton School, plus a few additional extensions, are being incorporated
into this simple_shell.  This man page is not intended to be a tutorial or
a complete specification of the simple_shell.

   Overview
The
.B simple_shell
is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal,
interprets them, and generally executes other commands.  It is a program
that can run when a user execute it into the system.  The simple_shell was
implemented in C language and provides a variety of features to aid
interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretative language is
common to both interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts).
That is, commands can be typed directly to the running simple_shell or can
be put into a file and the file can be executed directly by the simple_shell.

line to be ignored.
